What is web?

Ans: Web is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people to access and share information through websites and webpages.

What is website?

Ans: Website is a collection of related webpages that are designed to provide information and functionality to users.

In otherwords, a website is a complex system that relies on the interaction between servers, browsers, and databases to deliver content and functionality to users over the internet.

How a website can work?

Ans:A website works by using a combination of different technologies and systems to deliver content to users through a web browser.

some basic overview of website working is shown below:

When a user enters a website's domain name into their web browser, that browser sends a request to DNS(Domain Name System) Server to look at the IP address associated with domain name requesting the website's content.

Domain name is like www.google.com

Web browser responds to the request by sending website's files and adta back to the user's web browser.And also it interprets the website's HTML, CSS- and JavaScript code to display the content on user's screen.

The user can interact with the website by clicking on links, filling forms and performing other actions,which may leads to additional requests and responses between web browser and the server.

The website may store user data and preferences in a database or in the user's device and allowing personalized experiences and persistent user sessions.

What is webdevelopment?

Ans:Webdevelopment is the process of creating and maintaining of websites and web applications.

Webdevelopment process involves a few stages includes:

Planning: Defining the website's purpose, target audience and functionality and creating a project plan.

Design: Creating a visual design of website including layout, topography,and colour scheme.

Front-end development: Building user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Back-end development: Creating the server side functionality using programming languages such as python, PHP and interacting with databases to store and retrieve data.

Testing: Tesing a website's functionality, usability and performance to ensure it meets the intended requirements.

Deployment: Publishing the website to a web server or hosting a platform making it available to users.

Front-end development: The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It also referred to as the client side of the application.

CSS: It stands for Cascading Style Sheet.It is used to style our website.

JavaScript: It is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behaviour to website.

By using a front-end framework, developers can Speed up development, Reduce code complexity, Achieve consistency across projects.
 
Front end frameworks and libraries:

AngularJS
React.js
VueJS
jQuery
Bootstrap
Material UI
Tailwind CSS
jQuery UI

Backend development: Backend is a server side of a website. It is a part of website that users can't see and interact with it. It is used to store and arrange the data.

Backend includes the following languages:

PHP: PHP is a server side scripting language designed specially for web development.

Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages, it is highly scalable.

Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

Node.js: Node.js is an open source and cross platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.

Backend frameworks are Express, Django, Rails, Spring...
